Welcome! 👋 Whether you’re a beginner, student, or experienced developer, your contributions are truly valued. We are building an AI-driven future for task management and media, and we’re excited to have you on board!

## 🛠 Development Standards

To maintain code quality and project integrity, please adhere to the following technical requirements:

* **Framework:** Built using **React 19** and **Streamlit**.

* **Styling:** Use **Tailwind CSS** for all new React components.

* **Naming Conventions:**

* `PascalCase` for React components (e.g., `PostCard.jsx`).

* `camelCase` for variables and functions.


* **Linting:** You **must** run `npm run lint` and fix all warnings before committing.

* **Code Quality:** Follow Python (PEP8) for backend scripts. Write clean, modular, and documented code.

## 🚦 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Getting Started

1. **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

2. **Environment:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before starting development.

3. **Branching:** Create a descriptive feature branch:
`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

### 2️⃣ Respecting Assignments

* **Wait for Assignment:** Wait for an issue to be **officially assigned** to you before starting work or submitting a PR.

* **Unsolicited PRs:** Pull Requests for unassigned issues will be closed.

* **Issue Limit:** Contributors can request a **maximum of 3 issues** per day. More will only be granted once current tasks are completed.

### 3️⃣ Testing & Visuals (Mandatory)

* **Issue Reporting:** You **must** provide screenshots of the current state when opening an Issue.

* **PR Submission:** You **must** provide screenshots or GIFs of the new changes in your Pull Request.

* **Validation:** Ensure your feature works locally and doesn't break existing functionality.

## 📝 Commit Messages

We follow the `type(scope): subject` format:

* `feat:` A new feature

* `fix:` A bug fix

* `docs:` Documentation changes

* `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature

---

## ⏱️ Time Constraints & Disqualification

* **Assignment Window:** Once assigned, work must begin immediately.

* **Standard Deadline:** Tasks should ideally be completed within **30 minutes to 48 hours**.

* **Grace Period:** If no progress is shown after **72 hours**, the issue will be unassigned.

* **Stale PRs:** If you fail to respond to requested changes within **24 hours**, the PR may be closed.

* **Automatic Disqualification:** Submitting a PR that fails the build, ignores linting rules, lacks mandatory screenshots, or duplicates someone else's assigned work will result in immediate disqualification.

---

## 🚫 Community Guidelines & Morale

* **Positive Environment:** We maintain a respectful and inclusive space.

* **Morale:** Negative comments on assigned issues that discourage other contributors are strictly prohibited.

* **Harassment:** Discrimination of any kind will result in an immediate ban.
